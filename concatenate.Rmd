## Overview

This is an R Markdown document that can be dropped one level up from a folder with individual csv files you want to concatenate (bind by rows) for later analysis.

### Load individual csvs

```{r concatenate, warning=FALSE}
setwd("raw1") #this is the folder name that contains the individual csvs from exp1
filenames <- list.files(full.names=TRUE) #lists each file in the folder

data <- data.frame()

All <- lapply(filenames, function(i){
  temp <- read.csv(i)
  temp$identifier <- i
  data <- smartbind(data, temp)
}) #function that reads the csv for all files listed in 'filenames'

data <- do.call(smartbind, All) #use function and bind the read csv files be row into a large data frame
```

### Save combined data frame

```{r save_csv}
write.csv(data, "inst-cat-uc-2.csv", row.names = FALSE) #save the large data frame as its own csv file
```
